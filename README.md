If you have reached this point, do not forget to put your name in the list of AUTHORS through this same platform

Next I will put some important conditions to work with this repository, seeking to avoid unnecessary errors and setbacks

Always refer to the file example.sh

0. To clone this repository in your terminal use the git clone command and then the address that appears:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/SharaGB/Test-suite.git
```

1. All tests must be named as follows:

> test_authorname.sh

If you are going to upload more than one test you can number it like this:

> test_authorname1.sh

2. Since this are scripts, all tests must be started by the line #! / Bin / bash

> #!/bin/bash

3. Always remember to give permisions to your script, we suggest the next line:

> chmod 777 test_authorname1.sh

4. When executing any script your executable file it should be named:

> hsh (./hsh)

5. Never forget do git pull of all files but when gonna do git push you only have to attach the file that you created.

#### *And thats all, now you just have to test this in your shell, please be clear with your script and dont be affraid to contact the author of the test for more info. ‚ù§*
